"# CrawlIndexSearch" 
This project starts with a web crawler in Java, using Crawler4j, which crawls a specific domain and downloads the HTML pages encountered. 
The downloaded pages were then ranked based on PageRank algorithm using NetworkX package.
Apache Solr is used to index these pages, and a simple Web UI is given to search for queries specific to that domain. 
The search also includes spell check and autosuggest features.
